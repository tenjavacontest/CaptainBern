# DogeDisguise

Start time: 4pm (UTC)

Theme: Entities

CB Build: 1.6.4

# Description
This plugin will disguise mobs as something else. You can either define a disguise for
each mob in the config or you can set this to random so each mob will appear differently on
each client.

At the moment the plugin is very laggy but I think I can improve the code and make it less-laggy in the future.
