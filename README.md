# DogeDisguise

Start time: 4pm (UTC)

Theme: Entities

CB Build: 1.7.2

# Description
This plugin will disguise mobs as something else. You can either define a disguise for
each mob in the config or you can set this to random so each mob will appear differently on
each client.

(you can only disguise mobs, disguising a mob as a player doesn't work for some reason)
(the disguises only get applied to new spawned entities/when the spawn packet is send to the player)

At the moment the plugin is very laggy but I think I can improve the code and make it less-laggy in the future.
