# BetterThanHorses AKA InkHearth

This plugin adds the same functionality to books as seen in the book "InkHearth".
However due to the limitations of minecraft I can't make it perfect :(
The Plugin will let several things happen when a player opens a book.
Sever creatures will spawn, there will be storms (not really) and stuff.

The recipe for the book:
ABA
BCB
ABA
Where A is a Diamond Block, B is an Iron Block and C is a Book and Quill.
